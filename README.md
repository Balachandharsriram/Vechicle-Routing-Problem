## 📌 Introduction  
The **Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)** is a combinatorial optimization problem that aims to determine the most efficient routes for a fleet of vehicles delivering goods to multiple locations. This repository provides various algorithmic solutions to optimize logistics operations.  

## 🛠️ Features  
✅ Multi-vehicle route optimization 🚛  
✅ Supports Genetic Algorithm, Simulated Annealing & more 🧠  
✅ Interactive route visualization on maps 🗺️  
✅ Scalable for real-world logistics 📦  
✅ Simple interface for adding locations 📍

## 🚀 Getting Started  
### 1️⃣ Installation  
Clone this repository and install dependencies:  
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Balachandharsriram/Vechicle-Routing-Problem.git  
cd Vechicle-Routing-Problem  
pip install -r requirements.txt  
```

### 2️⃣ Usage  
Run the VRP solver with sample data:  
```sh
python main.py --input data/sample.csv  
```
